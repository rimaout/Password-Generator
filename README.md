This is my first time coding an app and working with interfeces.
I did this project only as an exercise to learn python and interface developing.

## Features 
- Simple an minimal interface
- Fully written in python
- Interfece made usinging the [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) module, a simpler and more modern version of [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) module
