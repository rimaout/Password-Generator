This is a simple Python app that generates random passwords. This is my first time making a "appication" so this is a learning exercise to gain experience with Python and interface development.

### Features
- Simple an minimal interface
- Fully written in python
- Interfece made usinging the [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) module, a simpler and more modern version of [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) module

### Important Note

This app is just a proof-of-concept and was created as a learning exercise. It not intended to be used to generate passwords for sensitive information, since it has not been thoroughly tested or reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
